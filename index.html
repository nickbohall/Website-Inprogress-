        <h1>A LITTLE ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>
            While my job title has changed throughout my career, what has not changed is my love of solving complex problems.
            Whether a mechanical engineer, data analyst, or programmer, I have always been passionate about taking on
            challenging projects and diving deeper into the unknown. My current professional interests have been around developing
            algorithms in python to predict outcomes in sports and e-sports.
        </p>
        <p>
            On a personal note, I'm a big fan of sports like beach volleyball, golf, and pretty much any racket sport. I also greatly enjoy
            hiking with my girlfriend, PC games with friends that have become long distance, and traveling to and exploring new,
            interesting places when I can.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently I work as data analyst at Wiland creating predictive models to help our clients better market to their customers.
            I am responsible for building statistical & machine learning models and handling the quality control of the modelling process.
            While most of my programming experience has been more statistically focused in Python, I decided to take on a new challenge,
            learn a bit of web development, and create this website to easily share my projects with others :).
